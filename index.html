									<h3>Critical and Creative thought development</h3>
									<p>Through use of differentiation and introducing new challenging lessons for students I have enforced a change within my students, requiring them to develop and build their critical and creative thought skills. Compared to working through the motions of school, I aim to build their thought processing skills and enable them to think for themselves and develop methods to beat problems they may face.</p>

									<h3>Welding and advanced metal skills</h3>
									<p>My approach to Metalwork and Industrial technology in general is to modernise the lessons whilst also maintaining age old techniques. Modern techniques including CNC machining and modern welding (tig) and older techniques such as metal forging and metal forming. Combining these two techniques will give students a good overall understanding of metal, how the structure of metal exists and how it can be modified, through folding, shrinking, stretching, welding, heating, annealing, tempering and work hardening. </p>

									<h3>Literacy and Numeracy through Industrial technology</h3>
									<p>Compared to common believe of Industrial technology being all physical and hands on, students are also required to work on their numeracy and literacy skills. Students are required to produce an in depth portfolio outlining their ideas, designs, processes, production and evaluation. The better their portfolio, the better they are able to correspond what they have achieved and better their marks through showing what they produced. Students numeracy skills are tested in this production as well, students are to measure and make projects constantly where they are required to use the minimal amount of materials, this means their measurements need to be precise. The stakes rise further when students are pushed to design more challenging projects, often with intricate shapes and angles, meaning trigonometry and Pythagoras’ theorem is used weekly and all students are required to know and understand how it works. </p>

										<h3>Tig welding</h3>
										<p>TIG stands for tungsten inert gas and is technically called gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). The process uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode that delivers the current to the welding arc.</p>

										<h3>Mig welding</h3>
										<p>MIG welding is an arc welding process in which a continuous solid wire electrode is fed through a welding gun and into the weld pool, joining the two base materials together. A shielding gas is also sent through the welding gun and protects the weld pool from contamination. In fact, MIG stands for metal inert gas. The technical name for it is gas metal arc welding (or GMAW), and the slang name for it is wire welding.</p>

										<h3>Plasma cutting</h3>
										<p>Plasma cutting (plasma arc cutting) is a melting process in which a jet of ionised gas at temperatures above 20,000°C is used to melt and expel material from the cut. During the process, an electric arc is struck between an electrode (cathode) and the workpiece (anode).</p>
